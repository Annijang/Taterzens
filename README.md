A fabric citizens attempt.

## Downloading it from GH actions
1. Go to [GH actions](https://github.com/samolego/Taterzens/actions) and click on the latest commit.
2. On the bottom there's a link to the `Artifacts`. Click it to download.
3. Unzip the file and put it in `mods/` folder.

## I'm brave enough to build it myself!

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/samolego/Taterzens.git
```

2. Go in the `Taterzens` folder.
3. Run the build script (you might want to omit `./`).
```
./gradlew build
```
