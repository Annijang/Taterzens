# Playing with Taterzens

---


## What is a Taterzen?

It's a rather silly nickname for NPC, which stands for **Non-Player-Character**.

It can be summoned with `/npc create <name of the taterzen>`.
If you prefer using a `GUI`, just run `/npc` and navigate to `create` node.

## GUI navigation

To use `GUI`, enter `/npc` command.
Gui is created from command itself, therefore it has same child GUIs as commands.

Inputs to GUI are handled via anvil GUI.

* to execute a node, **right click** the item in menu
* to go to child GUI, **left click** the item in menu (if there's no more child GUIs, left clicking will execute it as well.)
