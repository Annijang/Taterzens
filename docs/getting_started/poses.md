# Posing Taterzens

---


## Cusom poses

Taterzens support changing their pose
```
/npc edit pose <pose to use>
```

When [entity type](./types.md) is set to `PLAYER`, "working" poses are

* standing (default)
* swimming
* sneaking / crouching
* sleeping

other poses usually just change the name position and do not appear visually different.
