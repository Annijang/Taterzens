# Free Movement

---


## We have our own rights!

1. If you have a non-escapable area, you can use the following command
```
/npc edit movement FREE
```
as it makes the Taterzen move around freely with no restrictions.

<video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="100%">
	<source src="../../../assets/video/free_movement.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	<p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

2. For following the [path](../path.html) but enabling *long* rests and looking around, use
```
/npc edit movement PATH
```
