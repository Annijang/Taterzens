## Taking care of fitness

Since Taterzens extend the Minecraft's vanilla `PathfinderMob`, they can
perform pathfinding.

Movement of Taterzens could be divided in 3 categories:

* free movement (Wandering around, random looking, following the path with rests)
* strict movement (Non-stop following the path / looking at the player)
* follow movement (Following specified targets)


If you don't want the Taterzen to move, you can use
`/npc edit movement NONE` (default).
